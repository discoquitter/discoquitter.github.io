      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        My journey in healthcare started as the Head of Administration at Lilavati Hospital where we built some of Mumbai’s first patient service teams (long before "patient experience" became a buzzword). I then went on to lead the hospital’s international expansion into Kenya.<br><br>

        Later, I scaled patient experience systems across multiple diagnostic centers at NM Medical, adapting to high-volume operations. Over the years, I’ve developed systems that serve everyone from families to high-profile patients like the Dalai Lama, Amitabh Bachchan, and Sachin Tendulkar.

      <h2>My Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        Hospitals grow when patients trust them enough to return, refer others, and recover faster.<br><br>

        In an industry defined by high stakes and noise, patient experience is one of the few true competitive advantages left. Not a checkbox, but a strategic asset that quietly compounds over time.<br><br>

        I build sustainable, high-impact, patient-centric care models that actually work.<br><br>

        I work with teams who understand:<br><br>

        You don't win healthcare by marketing but by earning trust, the kind that people would choose with their lives, not once, but twice.
