      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>My journey in healthcare started as the Head of Administration at Lilavati Hospital where we built some of Mumbai’s first patient service teams, (long before "patient experience" became a buzzword), I then went on to lead the hospital’s international expansion into Kenya.</p>
      <p>Later, I scaled patient experience systems across multiple diagnostic centers at NM Medical, adapting to high-volume operations. Over the years, I’ve developed systems that serve everyone from families to high-profile patients like the Dalai Lama, Amitabh Bachchan, and Sachin Tendulkar.</p>

      <h2>My Philosophy</h2>
      <p>Hospitals grow when patients trust them enough to return, refer others, and recover faster.</p>
      <p>In an industry defined by high stakes and noise, patient experience is one of the few true competitive advantages left. Not a checkbox, but a strategic asset that quietly compounds over time.</p>
      <p>I build sustainable, high-impact, patient-centric care models that actually work.</p>
      <p>I work with teams who understand:</p>
      <p>You don't win healthcare by marketing but by earning trust, the kind that people would choose with their lives, not once, but twice.</p>
